    <p><del>Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/)</del> is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface 
        without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also 
        used to temporarily replace text in a <u> process called greeking</u>, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or 
        publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
    </p>
    <b>Lorem ipsum</b> is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and 
    philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. <strong>The first two words 
    themselves are a truncation of 'dolorem ipsum' ('pain itself').</strong>
